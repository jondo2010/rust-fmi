    /// ## Tolerance control
    /// * Under ModelExchange: If tolerance = Some(..) then the model is called with a numerical
    ///   integration scheme where the step size is controlled by using `tolerance` for error
    ///   estimation (usually as relative tolerance). In such a case, all numerical algorithms used
    ///   inside the model (for example to solve non-linear algebraic equations) should also operate
    ///   with an error estimation of an appropriate smaller relative tolerance.
    /// * Under CoSimulation: If tolerance = Some(..) then the communication interval of the slave
    ///   is controlled by error estimation. In case the slave utilizes a numerical integrator with
    ///   variable step size and error estimation, it is suggested to use `tolerance` for the error
    ///   estimation of the internal integrator (usually as relative tolerance). An FMU for
    ///   Co-Simulation might ignore this argument.

    /// within the given boundaries. Argument `start_time` is the fixed initial value of the
    /// independent variable [if the independent variable is "time", `start_time` is the starting

    /// the stop time of the simulation] and if the environment tries to compute past `stop_time`
