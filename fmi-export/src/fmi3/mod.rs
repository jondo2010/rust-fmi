//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The [`crate::export_fmu`] macro generates the necessary C-API bindings for the exported FMU.
//! Many of these bindings operate on a [`binding::fmi3Instance`], which is an opaque pointer to an
//! instance of [`instance::ModelInstance`].
//!
//! [`instance::ModelInstance`] implements the [`Common`] trait, which provides the actual implementation of
//! the FMI 3.0 API. All user-model-specific functions are delegated to the [`Model`] trait,
//! which the user model must implement.

// Disable coverage for the export module. Due to some bug in llvm-cov, the generated C functions
// are never covered. This is ok since they are just thin wrappers around the Rust functions.
